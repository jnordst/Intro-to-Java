    // Functions are a way to organize code into reusable blocks.
    // Functions are also called methods.
    // Functions are defined with the following syntax:

    public void myFunction() {
        // Code to be executed
    }

    // Lets break down exactly what is happening here...

    // First, we have the access modifier, which is public.
    // This means that the function can be accessed from anywhere.

    // Next, we have the return type, which is void.
    // This means that the function does not return a value. It simply executes some code.

    // Next, we have the name of the function, which is myFunction.
    // This is the name that we will use to call the function.

    // Next, we have the parameters of the function, which are empty. ()
    // Inside these parentheses we can define parameters that the function will accept.
    // We will cover parameters in more detail later.

    // Finally, we have the body of the function, which is the code that will be executed when the function is called.
    // The code block is enclosed inside curly braces. { code }

    // Now that we have defined the function, we can call it from anywhere in our code.
    // To call a function, we simply write the name of the function followed by parentheses.
    // myFunction();
}
